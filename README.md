# JFKFILES
This was Project JFK—a full-scale, AI-powered, forensic investigation into the 2,300+ so-called “JFK declassified files.” After 19 hours of my server grinding through more than 80,000 pages, what did I get?

Over 1,200 pages of structured forensic intelligence or I thought so, processed by a Python program I wrote—designed to extract dates, names, relationships, and timelines from every dusty corner of every grainy scan and half-legible scribble. I then wrote a script to let AI have it’s way with each page, extracting critical information one page at a time. Names, Dates, places and events, everything was directed.

This wasn’t guesswork. It was surgical, repeatable, and powered by real analytics.

Let me walk you through what that looked like:

Project JFK: How We Did It
All 2,300 + PDFs downloaded into one local repository.
AI-powered document processing for the content, and custom logic to decode handwriting, nicknames, aliases, and cross-references.
Names. Dates. Events. Places. Relationships. All extracted and indexed in a forensic-level analysis.
Deconflicted names, matched timelines, looked for co-occurrences, causal links, and contradictions.
Cross-referenced committee statements with public narratives.
Ran over 1200 pages of condensed forensic extracts through analytics to track every name that ever shared a document with Kennedy or Oswald.
